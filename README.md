# Modular Bulk RNA-seq Analysis RShiny Tool Suite

**Author:** Eren Ada, PhD
**Date:** 05/13/2025

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive and modular bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis tool using RShiny. The suite will consist of several interconnected RShiny applications, each dedicated to a specific stage of the RNA-seq analysis workflow:

1.  **QC & Pre-processing Tool:** For quality control, normalization, and filtering of raw count matrices.
2.  **Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analysis Tool:** For identifying differentially expressed genes.
3.  **Pathway & Functional Enrichment Analysis Tool:** For interpreting DEG lists through pathway and GO term enrichment.
4.  **Advanced Visualization Tool:** For creating custom, publication-quality plots.

This modular approach allows for focused development, easier maintenance, and flexibility for users to utilize specific components as needed.

## Roadmap

For a detailed development plan, please see the [Framework Roadmap](./framework_roadmap.md).

## Getting Started

(This section will be updated with instructions on how to set up and run the individual RShiny modules as they are developed.)
