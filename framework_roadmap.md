# Framework Roadmap: QC & Pre-processing RShiny Tool

**Author:** Eren Ada, PhD
**Date:** 05/29/2025
**Version:** 2.0

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a comprehensive Quality Control & Pre-processing tool for bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data built using RShiny. This tool focuses exclusively on the critical first step of RNA-seq analysis: data validation, quality assessment, filtering, and normalization. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly, robust, and extensible platform that prepares raw count data for downstream analysis in separate, specialized applications.

**Note:** This represents a focused approach where each major analysis component (QC/Pre-processing, Differential Expression, Pathway Analysis, Advanced Visualization) will be developed as separate, standalone RShiny applications. This QC tool will serve as the foundation, producing clean, well-characterized data for subsequent analysis tools.

## 2. Core Philosophy

*   **Modularity:** This QC tool will be a standalone application that can interface with other analysis tools through standardized data exports.
*   **Comprehensiveness:** The tool will incorporate a wide range of standard and advanced QC options and normalization methods.
*   **User-Friendliness:** The interface will be intuitive, guiding users through QC analysis with clear instructions and interactive visualizations.
*   **Reproducibility:** The tool will encourage reproducible research by keeping track of parameters and generating detailed QC reports.
*   **Extensibility:** The modular design within the QC tool should facilitate the addition of new QC features or normalization methods.
*   **Data Export:** Clean, standardized data export formats that can be easily imported into other RNA-seq analysis tools.
