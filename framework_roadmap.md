# Framework Roadmap: Modular Bulk RNA-seq Analysis RShiny Tool

**Author:** Eren Ada, PhD
**Date:** 05/13/2025
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a comprehensive and modular bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis tool built using RShiny. The tool will be developed as a suite of interconnected applications, allowing users to perform a complete analysis workflow from raw data to insightful visualizations. The primary goal is to leverage existing scripts and pipelines to create a user-friendly, robust, and extensible platform.

## 2. Core Philosophy

*   **Modularity:** Each major analysis step will be a separate RShiny application. This allows for focused development, easier maintenance, and the possibility for users to utilize only the modules they need.
*   **Comprehensiveness:** Each module will aim to incorporate a wide range of standard and advanced options for its respective analysis stage.
*   **User-Friendliness:** The interface will be intuitive, guiding users through the analysis with clear instructions and interactive visualizations.
*   **Reproducibility:** The tool will encourage reproducible research by keeping track of parameters and potentially generating reports.
*   **Extensibility:** The modular design should facilitate the addition of new features or analysis types in the future.

## 3. Application Modules

The project will be developed in the following distinct application modules:

### 3.1. Module 1: QC & Pre-processing Tool

*   **Objective:** Provide tools for quality control, normalization, filtering, and pre-processing of raw count matrices to prepare them for differential gene expression analysis.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Input:
        *   Raw count matrices (e.g., from featureCounts, HTSeq-count, output of pipelines like RNA-seek).
        *   Sample metadata file (crucial for QC and downstream analysis).
    *   Data Loading & Initial Inspection:
        *   Flexible upload options for count data and metadata.
        *   Validation of data formats and consistency (e.g., matching sample names).
        *   Summary statistics (library sizes, number of detected genes per sample).
    *   Quality Control & Visualization on Counts:
        *   Distribution plots (e.g., boxplots of log-counts per sample).
        *   Detection of genes with low counts/expression across samples.
        *   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) / Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) plots for initial sample clustering, outlier detection, and batch effect visualization (if batch information is in metadata).
        *   Sample-to-sample correlation heatmaps.
    *   Filtering:
        *   Filtering of low-expressed genes based on user-defined criteria (e.g., minimum counts in a minimum number of samples).
        *   Optional filtering of samples based on QC metrics (e.g., library size, gene detection rate outliers).
    *   Normalization:
        *   Common normalization methods (e.g., Counts Per Million (CPM), Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) for edgeR, Relative Log Expression (RLE) / median of ratios for DESeq2).
        *   Visualization of data before and after normalization (e.g., PCA, boxplots).
    *   Output:
        *   Filtered and normalized count matrices.
        *   QC reports, summary statistics, and various plots (PCA, heatmaps, etc.).
        *   Data object ready for DEG analysis (e.g., DGEList for edgeR, DESeqDataSet for DESeq2, or a generic expression matrix).
*   **Starting Point:** Leverage existing R scripts and best practices for count matrix QC, filtering, and normalization (e.g., using principles from `edgeR`, `DESeq2`, `limma` pre-processing steps).

### 3.2. Module 2: Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analysis Tool

*   **Objective:** Perform comprehensive DEG analysis from pre-processed and normalized count data.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Input: Filtered and normalized count matrices (output from Module 1), sample metadata file (detailing experimental design and conditions).
    *   Normalization methods (e.g., TPM, FPKM, TMM, RLE).
    *   DEG analysis using established methods:
        *   DESeq2
        *   edgeR
        *   limma-voom

    *   Interactive visualizations:
        *   Volcano plots
        *   MA plots
        *   Heatmaps of DEGs
        *   PCA plots, MDS plots
    *   Filtering and selection of DEGs based on p-value, FDR, log-fold change.
    *   Output: Normalized count tables, DEG lists, various plots.
*   **Starting Point:** Adapt existing DEG analysis R scripts.

### 3.3. Module 3: Pathway & Functional Enrichment Analysis Tool

*   **Objective:** Identify biological pathways, GO terms, and other functional categories enriched in the list of DEGs.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Input: List of DEGs (gene IDs, fold changes, p-values).
    *   Support for multiple gene ID types (Ensembl, Entrez, Gene Symbol).
    *   Databases for enrichment:
        *   Gene Ontology (GO)
        *   KEGG pathways
        *   Reactome
        *   MSigDB (hallmark gene sets, etc.)
    *   Statistical methods for enrichment analysis (e.g., hypergeometric test, GSEA).
    *   Interactive visualizations:
        *   Bar plots/dot plots of enriched terms.
        *   Enrichment maps/networks.
        *   Visualizing DEGs on pathways (e.g., Pathview integration).
    *   Output: Tables of enriched pathways/terms, visualization files.
*   **Starting Point:** Utilize existing scripts using packages like `clusterProfiler`, `fgsea`, `gage`.

### 3.4. Module 4: Advanced Visualization & Custom Plots Tool

*   **Objective:** Provide a flexible platform for generating publication-quality custom visualizations beyond the standard plots in other modules.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Input: Various data types generated from previous modules (e.g., count matrices, DEG lists, pathway results).
    *   Customizable plotting options for:
        *   Gene expression profiles (e.g., specific genes across samples/conditions).
        *   Sample correlation heatmaps.
        *   Network visualizations (e.g., gene co-expression networks, protein-protein interaction networks if applicable).
        *   Integrative plots combining different data types.
